# QR-CODE
PYTHON PROJECT
1.	PROJECT EXPLANATION
This project, named "QR Code," is a simple GUI application that allows users to generate QR codes by entering text. It utilizes the PyQRCode library for generating QR codes and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical interface. Users input their desired text into a text entry field, click a button labeled "Generate QR Code," and the application creates a corresponding QR code image, which is saved as 'myqr.png' in the current directory.
2.	CHALLENGES
Some potential challenges in developing this project might include:
•	Handling user input validation to ensure that the text entered is valid for QR code generation.
•	Managing the layout and design of the graphical interface to make it user-friendly.

3.	CHALLENGES OVERCOMED
These challenges can be overcome through careful planning, understanding of both libraries used, and thorough testing. Validating user input and error handling can ensure a smooth user experience.
4.	AIM
